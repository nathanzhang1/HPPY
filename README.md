This will start the Expo development server and display a QR code in your terminal.

## Running the App

Once the development server is running, you have several options to run the app:

### Option 1: Run on Physical Device (Recommended for Quick Testing)

1. Install the **Expo Go** app on your iOS or Android device

   - **Android**: Use the Expo Go app's QR scanner
3. The app will load on your device

### Option 2: Run on iOS Simulator (Mac only)

```bash
npm run ios
```

Or press `i` in the terminal where Expo is running.

### Option 3: Run on Android Emulator

1. Start your Android emulator from Android Studio
2. Run:
   ```bash
   npm run android
   ```
   Or press `a` in the terminal where Expo is running.

### Option 4: Run in Web Browser

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Metro bundler error"**
   - Clear cache: `expo start -c`

2. **"Cannot connect to Metro"**
   - Ensure your device and computer are on the same network
   - Try using tunnel mode: `expo start --tunnel`

3. **"Module not found"**
   - Delete node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

4. **iOS Simulator not launching**
   - Ensure Xcode and Command Line Tools are installed
   - Try: `sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app`
